# Octopus Code Test - Tristan Plet

Just a quick note - I have really enjoyed doing this test! I learned so much in the process, mainly around GraphQL and testing, which are areas I was really keen to get more comfortable with. This was definitely good for my development. Thanks ðŸ˜„

# Instructions for setup

### First we need to go to the server folder, install our dependencies and spin up the backend

Create a virtualenv in which we can install the dependencies

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now we can install our dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To add some data to your database do the following:

```
./manage.py migrate
# Load some example data
./manage.py loaddata products
```

Now you should be ready to start the server:

```
./manage.py runserver 8000
```

Here is the [query to run to get you started](<http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql#operationName=getProductById&query=query%20getProductById%20%7B%0A%20%20product(productId%3A%201)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20power%0A%20%20%20%20description%0A%20%20%20%20price%0A%20%20%20%20quantity%0A%20%20%20%20brand%0A%20%20%20%20weight%0A%20%20%20%20height%0A%20%20%20%20width%0A%20%20%20%20length%0A%20%20%20%20modelCode%0A%20%20%20%20colour%0A%20%20%20%20imgUrl%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A>)

### Now let's serve the app!

Go to octopus/client

Run ` npm i`

Serve the app ` serve -s build`

Install serve if needed ` npm install -g serve `

Happy shopping!

To run the tests, run ` yarn test`

## The Journey

I started by planning excalty what I wanted to achieve during the test:
- Back up the project on a private github repo
- Start mobile first
- Acheive cart functionality
- Learn how basic tests works
- Learn about the basics of GraphQL
- Use apollo-boost if time allows it

This code test has been my first code test for any industry role/work. I was nervous and very excited, but I have to say I honestly really enjoyed it and definitely learn quite a bit!

#### Organising Files
I set up the files as though this product was one of many, and the the app was ready to recevie more components. The fetch request is setup to use a different product id if one were to be added. 

#### Querying the data
This was my first experience working with GraphQL and I really enjoyed learning more about it! I'm really excited to start using it in my own personal projects. I started setting up apollo-boost, but ended up using a fetch request in the interest of time. But I already feel like I have learned tons online and am definietly onbaord with GraphQL now! 

#### Testing
I have wanted to learn more about testing for a while, and this was a great introduction. I took an extra hour to learn about it and am really glad I did so, as I feel like a more complete developper now. At first I ran into errors, as I also query the data on the landing page so needed the code to be asynchronous. 
Unfortunately I ran into a second error, which I didn't have time to solve. The second time the `<App/>` component was rendered, it wouldn't take me back to the landing page, so couldn't find the right elements. I have seen similar issues online cause by react-router-dom , and am confident that I could resolve it with more time ðŸ™‚

I am really looking forward to hearing your feedback! 

Thanks, Tristan
